Bytecode VMs

What is the current state of play? Why is real progress so difficult if the underlying ideas are so easy? Why might you want to build your own bytecode VM anyway?
I look through some current and historical examples, some VMs I have built, and the VM that I am currently working on, showing the general forces that act on the development of bytecode VMs, and an approach that I think actually works.
